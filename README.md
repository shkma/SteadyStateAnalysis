# SteadyStateAnalysis

This page is the digital appendix for the following submitted manuscript:
Kitayama S, Yang C. (Under Review). "Steady-state seismic response analysis of self-centering structural systems with viscous damping." Submitted to Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering.


This digital appendix provides the following materials:
i) Detailed derivation of steady-state response analysis formula that were omitted in the paper for clarity and page limitation;
ii) A MATLAB file "For_Sharing_nonlinear_elastic.m" computes steady state seismic response of nonlinear-elastic self-centering structural systems with added viscous damping;
iii) A MATLAB file "For_Sharing_elasto_plastic.m" computes steady state seismic response of elasto-plastic structural systems with added viscous damping and self-centering.
