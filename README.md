# SteadyStateAnalysis
MATLAB code to generate some results on the paper (Kitayama &amp; Yang, 202x).

A MATLAB file "For_Sharing_nonlinear_elastic.m" computes steady state seismic response of nonlinear-elastic self-centering structural systems with added viscous damping.
A MATLAB file "For_Sharing_elasto_plastic.m" computes steady state seismic response of elasto-plastic structural systems with added viscous damping and self-centering.
