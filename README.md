# SteadyStateAnalysis

This page is the digital appendix for the following journal article:
Shoma Kitayama, Cancan Yang. (2021). "Steady-state dynamic response analysis of self-centering structural systems with viscous damping." Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Volume 150, November 2021, 106926. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soildyn.2021.106926

This digital appendix provides the following materials:
i) Detailed derivation of steady-state response analysis formula that were omitted in the paper for clarity and page limitation;
ii) A MATLAB file "For_Sharing_nonlinear_elastic.m" computes steady state seismic response of nonlinear-elastic self-centering structural systems with added viscous damping;
iii) A MATLAB file "For_Sharing_elasto_plastic.m" computes steady state seismic response of elasto-plastic structural systems with added viscous damping and self-centering.
